# Data structure & Algorithms in C#

C# Data structure and algorithm basic/advanced topics practice and documentation. As a software engineer, it's imperative that you learn and master DSA. It will enable you to write clean and efficient code, not only that, but it will also help you ace coding interviews since most questions asked are based on DSA.

# What is a data structure?

A data structure is a format and named location that can be used to store, process, retrieve and organize data. Below are the basic of data structures in CS (Computer Science): ðŸ‘‡

## Stacks

Stacks is a LIFO (Last-in First-out) data structure that stores objects (passed in values) vertically. Example: ðŸ‘‡

```csharp
Stack<string> cars = new Stack<string>();
            
cars.Push("Corolla");
cars.Push("Tacoma");
cars.Push("Silverado");
cars.Push("Tesla");
```
**Common stacks method: ðŸ‘‡**

* .Push() => To push an item to the top of a stack
* .Peek() => To return the top item from a stack
* .Pop() => To remove item from the top of a stack
* .Contains() => To check whether an element exists in a stack
* .Clear() => To remove all items in a stack at once
* .Count() / .Length() => Return the number of items in a stack

## Queues

Queues is a FIFO (First-in First-out) data structure and collection of objects. Example: ðŸ‘‡

```csharp
 Queue<string> queues = new Queue<string>();
            
queues.Enqueue("Dave");
queues.Enqueue("Pete");
queues.Enqueue("James");
queues.Enqueue("Dapson");
```

**Common queues method: ðŸ‘‡**

* .Enqueue() => To add an item into the queue
* .Dequeue() => To remove an item from the beginning of the queue
* .Peek() => To return the beginning item from a queue
* .Contains() => To check whether an element exists in a queue
* .Clear() => To remove all items in a queue at once

## Priority queues

This is still a queue but with a twist, it doesn't work based on the FIFO rule. It will first serve/print items with high priority before printing an item with low priority. Example: ðŸ‘‡

```csharp
PriorityQueue<string, double> queues = new PriorityQueue<string,double>();

queues.Enqueue("Item One",2.7);
queues.Enqueue("Item Two",2.6);
queues.Enqueue("Item Three",3.5);
queues.Enqueue("Item Four",4.5);
queues.Enqueue("Item Five",1.9);

// Print all item & it's priority to the console with the `TryDequeue` method
while (queues.TryDequeue(out string? item, out double priority))
{
    Console.WriteLine($"{item} & it's Priority is: {priority}");
}
```

## LinkedLists

LinkedLists is a data structure that can handle dynamic data elements known as `node`. Each `node` consists of two fields; `1. data field`, `2. address field which will reference the next node`. The two types of LinkedList are: ðŸ‘‡

* Singly-linked list => Contains only an address which will reference the next nodes
* Doubly-linked list => Contains two addresses which will reference the prev and next nodes

Example of a doubly-linked list: ðŸ‘‡

```csharp
LinkedList<string> fruits = new LinkedList<string>();

fruits.AddLast("Mango");
fruits.AddLast("Orange");
fruits.AddLast("Watermelon");
fruits.AddFirst("Guava");

// Reverse the linked-list by calling the `.Reverse()` method
foreach (string fruit in fruits.Reverse())
{
    Console.WriteLine(fruit);
}
```

**Common LinkedLists method: ðŸ‘‡**

* .AddLast() => To add an element in a linked-list last position
* .AddFirst() => To add an element in a linked-list first position
* .Remove() => To remove a specified element from a linked-list
* .RemoveFirst() => To remove the first element from a linked-list
* .RemoveLast() => To remove the last element from a linked-list
* .Clear() => To clear the entire elements in a linked-list
* .Reverse() => To reverse the order of a linked-list

## Dynamic Arrays

Just as its name suggests, it's a dynamic and growable array that is not fixed which have advantages over static arrays. Example: ðŸ‘‡

```csharp
ArrayList games = new ArrayList();

games.Add("Call of Duty");
games.Add("Elden Ring");
games.Add("PUBG");
```

**Common Dynamic Arrays method: ðŸ‘‡**

* .Add() => To add an item
* .Insert() => To insert an item into the dynamic array at a specified index
* .Remove() => To remove a specified item from a dynamic array
* .RemoveRange() => To remove more than one item from a dynamic array using index
* .Count => To get the total number of item in a dynamic array
* .Clear() => To remove all items from a dynamic array at once
* .Sort() => To sort items in the array alphabetically or in ascending order
